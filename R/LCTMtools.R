#' LCTMtools: A package for computing a number of Latent Class Trajectory Model tools for a given hlme() object or SAS model.
#'
#' The LCTMtools package provides two categories of important functions:
#' LCTMtools (to test a models adequacy) and LCTMcompare (to aid model selection).
#'
#' @section LCTMtools functions:
#' The LCTMtools functions arw a selection of model adequacy tests for Latent Class Trajectory Models (LCTMs) which include the APPA (average posterior probability of assignment), the OCC (odds of correct classification), entropy, Relative entropy.
