#' Entropy
#'
#' A global measure of uncertainty with values close to zero implying a good model. Entropy is a global measure of classification uncertainty, which takes into account all N Ã— K posterior probabilities. The entropy of a model is defined as which takes values from [0,infinity), with higher values indicating a larger amount of uncertainty. Entropy values closest to 0 correspond to models with least classification uncertainty.
