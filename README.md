All statistical (R and SAS) codes used to implement Latent Class Trajectory Modelling and the tools described in the manuscript "A framework to construct and interpret latent class trajectory modelling", are available here and can be downloaded from www.github.com/hlennon/LCTMtools.  

An example (simulated) dataset 'bmi' and 'bmi_long' (long format version) is provided to describe the steps throughout.
